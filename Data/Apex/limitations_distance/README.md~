Limitations Testing: Distance (X translation)
=============================================

Data
----

This test data corresponds with the following distances:

20130726_1  -> [x = 0.50m +/- 2mm,  y = 0.00mm +/- 2mm, z = 34.50mm +/- 2mm]
20130726_2  -> [x = 1.50m +/- 2mm,  y = 0.00mm +/- 2mm, z = 34.50mm +/- 2mm]
20130726_3  -> [x = 2.00m +/- 2mm,  y = 0.00mm +/- 2mm, z = 34.50mm +/- 2mm]
20130726_4  -> [x = 2.50m +/- 2mm,  y = 0.00mm +/- 2mm, z = 34.50mm +/- 2mm]
20130726_5  -> [x = 0.75m +/- 2mm,  y = 0.00mm +/- 2mm, z = 34.50mm +/- 2mm]
20130726_6  -> [x = 1.25m +/- 2mm,  y = 0.00mm +/- 2mm, z = 34.50mm +/- 2mm]

20130726_7  -> [x = 1.00m +/- 2mm,  y = 0.00mm +/- 2mm, z = 34.50mm +/- 2mm]
20130726_8  -> [x = 1.75m +/- 2mm,  y = 0.00mm +/- 2mm, z = 34.50mm +/- 2mm]
20130726_9  -> [x = 2.25m +/- 2mm,  y = 0.00mm +/- 2mm, z = 34.50mm +/- 2mm]
20130726_10 -> [x = 2.75m +/- 2mm,  y = 0.00mm +/- 2mm, z = 34.50mm +/- 2mm]

Limitation
----------
The program was unable to collect data at 3.00m (robustfit did not have enough valid coordinates).

Apex Height Estimations
-----------------------
Apex Height (Relative to World):  34.50mm +/- 2mm
Lidar Height (Relative to World): 21.00mm +/- 2mm
Apex Height (Relative to Lidar):  13.50mm +/- 4mm

Assumptions
-----------
We are assuming that lidar origin is located at the center of the device.
