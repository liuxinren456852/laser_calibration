Testing: Y & X & Z translation && 20 Yaw & 3 Pitch 
==================================================

Data
----

This test data corresponds with the following distances (x = N mm where N is the lidar height relative to the base of the target):

    [x = 20.00mm +/- 2mm,  y = 100.00mm +/- 2mm, z = 3.50mm +/- 2mm]  
    [yaw = 20 deg +/- 1 deg, pitch = 3 deg +/- 1 deg, row = 0 deg +/- 2 deg ]

Assumptions
-----------
We are assuming that the lidar origin is located at the center of the device. 

Further Work
------------
Ensure to check the number of scan points need to calculate an apex.
